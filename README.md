
I have created a New Year countdown that features four circles representing the days, hours, minutes, and seconds remaining. The countdown includes attractive animations.

I utilized the `getTime` function to calculate the difference between the New Year and the current time. With this information, I created animations that reflect the filling of the circles and the movement of dots. For example, I used 365 days for the year and 60 minutes for the minute animation, ensuring that the visuals matched the respective time values.

Once the countdown concludes, a "Happy New Year" message will be displayed. I have hosted this countdown website on GitHub and my portfolio on Netlify.

All the skills shown in my portfolio are genuine. I apologize for the use of Lorem Ipsum text; I created this portfolio for a personal project and had to host it on Netlify in a hurry. Unfortunately, I didn't have time to finalize the details, so I appreciate your understanding. I am genuinely excited about this project!# New Year Countdown
